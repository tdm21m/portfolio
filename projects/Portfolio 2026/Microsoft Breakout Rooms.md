**Breakout Rooms — Microsoft Teams**

**Role** Sole Senior Designer leading vision and end-to-end design for organizer and participant experiences, collaborating with Product Management and Engineering.

**Problem** In early 2020, as the pandemic drove millions to remote work and learning, breakout rooms became one of the most requested features from customers. Teachers needed to split students into study groups. HR and corporate teams needed workgroup sessions for brainstorming and workshops. Zoom had it. We didn't. Leadership mandated we close this competitive gap.

**Challenge** Teams' backend couldn't create sub-meetings within a parent meeting — and the meeting canvas was non-interactive streaming video. My original vision was a spatial experience where organizers could see live feeds of each room on the canvas and drag-and-drop participants between them. The tech stack couldn't support it. So the design challenge became: how do you make managing separate, disconnected meetings feel like one unified breakout experience?

**Solution** I designed a two-surface management model. A modal dialog let organizers select participants from a list and bulk-assign them to rooms. A persistent side panel served as a command center — showing room status, participant assignments, and a single "Open" button to launch all rooms simultaneously. Participants received a notification and were moved into their rooms automatically, keeping the experience seamless for classrooms and large meetings alike.

**Outcome** I presented the long-term vision to Jeff Teper, Corporate Vice President of Office 365, establishing a northstar for the feature's evolution. Under a one-quarter deadline, we shipped an MVP that achieved competitive parity with Zoom during Teams' fastest growth period — the platform scaled from 20M to 75M daily active users that year. The feature continued to evolve with simplified assignments, organizer announcements to rooms, and participant shuffling.
